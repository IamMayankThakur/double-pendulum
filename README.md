## Double Pendulum Simulation
A simulation for the popular double pendulum experiment in classical physics. This has been created using p5.js.

p5 is a JavaScript library for processing. Read more about it [here](https://p5js.org/).


In physics and mathematics, in the area of dynamical systems, a double pendulum is a pendulum with another pendulum attached to its end, and is a simple physical system that exhibits rich dynamic behavior with a strong sensitivity to initial conditions. The motion of a double pendulum is governed by a set of coupled ordinary differential equations and is chaotic.

### TODO

* A cool idea would be to add sliders for the pendulum string length and the gravity etc for easier visualization.
* Will do this when free.
* If anyone wants to take it up as an exercise for learning p5, feel free to take it up and send a PR.
